        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blockchain is a series of concatenated text records protected through the application of cryptography and maintained by a collection of nodes connected, which are referred to as blocks. Each block contains the cryptographic
            hash of the previous block, its timestamp, and the transaction data. An actor’s involvement in a transaction initiates the creation of a block. Every single block is verified by all the other computers distributed in the network. The most
            special virtue of blockchain network is that it has no central authority. The design of these blocks ensures that the data the blockchain holds is held securely and prevented from tampering. Furthermore, blockchain’s decentralized nature allows
            ledger connected by blockchain to be effectively recorded and checked by all parties permanently. It is highly transparent and all users or those involved are accountable for their actions. Last but not least, transactions using blockchain
            technology is free, therefore, it is very likely that it will replace other models that rely on charging transaction fees in the future. In brief, the three main pillars of blockchain technology is decentralization, transparency, and immutability.
            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, the most common application of blockchain technology is commercial digital currency. For example, Bitcoin is established upon blockchain structure. Blockchain's virtues allow financial transactions
            to be decentralized and secured. Furthermore, blockchain brings to us other new applications, such as smart contracts, crowdfunding, supply chain auditing, and so on.
